            <h2>The Erlang Process</h2>
            <p>
            Erlang is built for massive concurrency. Processes are lightweight, they start and die quickly and 
            have very little overhead (about 300 words or a few k). Processes are completely independent of one
            another and can only communicate by passing messages. By default messages are asynchronous so unless you
            make them processes won't wait for a reply.
            </p>
            <p>
            Every concurrent part of your program should have it's own process. What does that mean? Here's some examples
                <ul>
                    <li>Every independent part that may fail but can be safely restarted: Database connections, web services
                    , every try/catch?</li>
                    <li>Each independent state: A system controlling 3 elevators for a 10 floor building
                    should have 13 processes. One for each independent part.</li>
                    <li>In the standard library every open file has its own process in the usual case</li>
                    <li>Some processes organize other processes: they control when other processes are started and
                    stopped, handle dependencies between others. Supervisors and workers</li>
                </ul>
            Processes communicate by copying messages to eachother. You can send any term to another process as a message
            by using the '!' operator. For example
            <pre>
% Self returns your own Pid 
% Useful to allow other processes to reply
&lt;Pid&gt; ! {hello, self()}
            </pre>
            Processes can listen for messages by using recieve.
            <pre>
recieve
    Pattern1 ->
        Body1;
    Pattern2 ->
        Body2;
    Any ->
        io:format("Got a message we didn't expect ~p~n",[Any])
end
            </pre>
            </p>
            <h2>Spawn</h2>
            <p>The spawn command is used to start new processes.
            <pre>
Pid = spawn(Module, Function, [Arguments, List]).
            </pre>
            This creates a new process, and helpfully gives you its Pid so that you can communicate with it.
            </p>
            <h2>Process Demo</h2>
            <h2>Registering</h2>
            <p>Sometimes it is more helpful to have a single name for a particular process. This way other
            processes don't need to look up its Pid to communicate.
            <pre>
% Name is an atom
register(Name, Pid).

% For example
register(firehall, self()).

% Now other processes can send messages to the firehall
% by using the atom it is named
firehall ! {fire, "123 Some St."}.
            </pre>
            </p>
            <h2>Linking</h2>
            <p>Processes that depend on eachother can be linked together.
            <pre>
link(Pid).
% Or as a single operation
spawn_link(Module, Function, Args).
            </pre>
            Links are two way and mark both processes as related. Processes that are linked will recieve messages
            from eachother when they die.
            </p>
            <h2>Process Death</h2>
            <p>
            When a process finishes execution or experiences an unrecoverable error it dies. We say that processes
            terminate for a certain reason. If the process simply executed the last line of code in it's function
            it terminates normally, otherwise the reason for termination is the error that caused the process to fail.
            </p>
            <p>
            When a process dies it sends a message to every linked process {'EXIT', FromPid, Reason}. 
            If this message specifies an non normal exit reason any linked process will also die. If you don't want 
            all of your linked processes to die in a massive chain reaction you can set the trap_exit process flag
            <pre>
process_flag(trap_exit,true).
            </pre>
            Now any abnormal terminations of linked processes will not kill this process. Instead it recieves the
            exit message as it would any other normal message and you can respond to it however you like.
            </p>
            <h2>Fault Tolerance</h2>
            <p>
            How does all this add up to fault tolerance? In normal programming would use try catch blocks to handle errors
            you can do something about but what about the ones you don't expect? You can try to anticipate every situation (hard)
            or you can catch every possible exception (Bad idea - what do you do with your program in an inconsistant state?). 
            In Erlang the process boundary acts like a try / catch. You spawn a process to try something if it fails the program
            is still in a known state and you can just restart from there. So in contrast to brittle try/catches that try to keep
            the main thread of your program from crashing, in Erlang you let it crash and then restart the appropriate part of the
            process tree. This means don't try to anticipate errors if you don't need to! Unanticipated errors should turn into
            log messages not program crashes.
            </p>
            <h3>Exercises</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Open doc_serv.erl to make a server that runs a document store like you defined earlier</li>
                <li>Open webs.erl and fill in the part that parses http requests using the pre defined functions
                in hyptxt.erl</li>
                <li>You can use fancy_ui.html to store documents (it expects you to open a tcp socket using webs.erl listening
                on port 4567)</li>
                <li>try to request a document you've saved by using your browser to navigate to localhost:4567/document_key</li>
