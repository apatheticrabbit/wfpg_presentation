            <h2>Modules</h2>
            <p>Each Erlang source file is a Module. It should be a collection of (hopefully related) functions. 
            Each Module is its own namespace and
            exports a public API of functions that other modules can call. 
            Recall that functions in other modules are called by prefixing 
            them with their module name as module:function()</p>
            <p>Modules can contain a number of directives that define the Module and metadata for the module. 
            There is only a couple that
            we will need.</p>
            <h3>Module Definition</h3>
            <p>The module definition directive is simply: -module(module_name). 
            This should be the first non-comment or whitespace line of a module.
            the module name as appears above is an atom that matched the name of the source file without its .erl extension.</p>
            <h3>Export</h3>
            <p>The export directive is a list of function names to export. 
            So if you want to export the start function (with zero arguments) 
            from your module the syntax is -export([start/0]). You can include more than one function name to export in the list. 
            You can also include more than one export directive in your module in order to organize the exports by logical categories. 
            For example you could include one export for the public API you expect callers to use and then another export 
            for functions not intended to be called by users of the module but instead by framework or library code. 
            This is a good practice to be more organized and revealing about your intentions.</p>
            <h3>Compiling Modules</h3>
            <p>Modules can be compiled and loaded into the VM to call their exported functions. This is done with the c(module_name). 
            function in the shell. The module_name atom is the same as the one used in the module directive. 
            The c() command expects the 
            source file to be in some place the running VM knows about. 
            The easiest way to make sure of that is to run the VM from the same
            directory as your source files. If you need to (like if you're running Windows) 
            you can change the current directory of the VM with
            the cd("path as a string"). command in the shell.</p>
            <p>That is all we'll need to know about modules to get going!</p>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>Functions are the bread and butter of programming in Erlang. Lets examine the parts of a function definition 
            starting with the simplest type.
            <pre>
function_name(Argument, List) ->
    function body line 1,
    function body line 2.
            </pre>
            This is a function it has two arguments (Argument and List). After the arrow '->' we put the function body. 
            The first line is an
            erlang expression, this line is ended with a comma to indicate more lines are included in this function body.
            The next line is the final line, the value of this line is the return value of the function.
            The function definition is ended with a full stop '.'.
            </p>
            <p>
            Functions can also include multiple clauses. What's a clause? It is basically a
            repeat function definition with a different header.
            The header must still take the same number of arguments but each header can have a different pattern 
            (or different guards as will be explained later). 
            Then when the function is called one particular clause is chosen by the runtime using pattern matching! 
            Function clauses before the last are ended with a semicolon instead of a full stop. 
            The entire function definition must be ended
            with a full stop.
            <pre>
% The literal in the argument list is pattern matched 
% when the function is called. This version of 'function_name' is called
% if list is empty.
function_name(Argument, []) ->
    empty;
% Otherwise this one is called. This will match for any two arguments
function_name(Argument, List) ->
    full.
            </pre>
            </p>
            <h3>Guards</h3>
            <p>
            What happens when you need to be more specific than just pattern matching for a function clause? 
            What if you want to match only when a number is not zero? That's when you can use guards. Guards are a boolean expression
            that comes after using the when keyword in a function header. 
            Multiple guards can be used with commas between denoting 'and' or semi-colons
            denoting 'or'. Guards can only use built in functions or operators because they need to be 
            guaranteed to have no side effects.
            </p>
            <pre>
my_divide(X,Y) when y /= 0 ->
    X/Y.

between_one_and_one_hundred(N) when N >=1, N =< 100 ->
    ok.
boolean(B) when B =:= true; B =:= false ->
    ok.
            </pre>
            <h3>Exercises</h3>
            <p>Open up the file my_first_funs.erl and follow the directions in there.</p>
            <h2>Controlling Flow</h2>
            <p>
            So far we've needed to define a new function or clause for each branch of operation. 
            That's kind of a pain what other options do we have?
            I'll show you two. Erlang's strange if expression and it's cooler cousin the case expression.
            <h3>If?</h3>
            <p>Erlang's if is basically a way to check guard expressions. Each guard had it's own body to execute and each body line. 
            Like a function body it is comma separated expressions. Except for the last line of a body which is ended with a semi-colon. 
            The final body line in the whole if does not require puncutation. 
            The last line of the body executed is the return value for the if expression.</p>
            <pre>
if
    guardExpression1 ->
        body1;
    guardExpression2 ->
        body2
end

if
    N >0 ->
        gt;
    true ->
        lt;
end
            </pre>
            Notice that there is no else. To achieve the same idea we use a guard of true which will always succeed.
            </p>
            <p>To be honest Erlang's if statement is kind of strange. That's OK don't use it unless you absolutely must. 
            Most of the time
            you will be using regular function clauses or case expressions which are frankly better almost always.
            </p>
            <h3>Case</h3>
            <p>A case statement is a way to match multiple patterns with a single expression. It looks a little like this</p>
            <pre>
case Expression of 
    Pattern1 [when optionalGuard1] ->
        body1;
    Pattern2 [when optionalGuard2] ->
        body2
end

case do_something() of
    ok ->
        "Succeeded! Go Hog Wild!"
    {error , _Reason} ->
        "Uh Oh!"
end
            </pre>
            <h2>Recursion</h2>
            <p>We're almost done the sequential parts of Erlang and we haven't even seen a loop yet. What's up with that? 
             Erlang doesn't have any looping constructs. Instead we can have functions call themselves over and over again. 
             Welcome to recursion.</p>
            <p>In recursion we break a problem down by finding the simplest case. Then we see how we can break down the problem again
            and again from an arbitrary case.</p>
            <pre>
% Find the length of a list.
recursive_length([]) ->
% The length of the empty set is 0
    0;
recursive_length([_| Tail]) ->
    1 + recursive_length(Tail).
            </pre>
            <h3>Tail Recursion</h3>
            <p>Isn't recursion supposed to be bad? 
            What about if we need a program to run a very long time. 
            Normally recursion needs to keep a frame on the stack for each
            execution of a function if it's not completely resolved. If we try to run a recursive loop for 
            too long won't the VM run out of
            memory and crash? Not if we use tail recursion. The VM is smart enough that if the last line of a function is just a plain
            function call it discards the last stack frame knowing it won't be needed. So that way we can run for as long as we want
            without running out of memory. Under most circumstances we can implement a regular recursive function by tail recursion
            by including an extra parameter as an accumulator.
            <pre>
tail_recursive_length([],Length) ->
% This is the base case signalling the end
% of the recursive loop
    Length;
tail_recursive_length([_|Tail], Length) ->
% Notice this is simply a function call, no other parts
% to this expression need to be kept on the stack.
    tail_recursive_length(Tail, Length) + 1.

% You will often see the main loops of independent processes implemented thus
% This is tail recursive and can run for as long as you please.
loop(State) ->
    NewState = do_stuff(State),
    loop(NewState).
            </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
            How do we choose which way to use? Isn't it safer to always use tail recursion? Nope. Tail recursion is harder to follow 
            and involves extra steps if you're building a list (see exercises). Usually, unless you're building the main loop of a long
            running process use regular recursion. It can often be less memory intensive and is more clear.
            </p>
