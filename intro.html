            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi I'm Justin Haywood. I currently work for Richardson International. 
            I spend most of my days coding PL/SQL and VBA. I'm fairly new
            to programming having graduated from Red River College's BIT program in May of this year. 
            Before that I worked as a manager in a wine 
            store for 6 years. I also have a BSc. in Math and Physics from the University of Manitoba.</p>
            <p>As you may guess it's my math background inclines me towards functional programming</p>
            <h2>Erlang</h2>
            <p>Erlang was first developed in the 1980's at Ericsson for programming telephone switches. It was released as open source in 1998.</p>
            <p>Erlang is a very practical language. It isn't very functionally pure like Haskell. It is actually designed from the bottom up to
            build fault tolerant highly available systems. These design decisions impact the language profoundly.</p>
            <p>Some of the core features are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Concurrency: The language contains built in primitives (Erlang processes) for multithreading and concurrency. 
                These are much lighter than threads in other languages and are used much more throughout Erlang. Processes
                can only communicate by passing messages and can never corrupt eachother's memory</li>
                <li>Distribution: The highly concurrent nature of Erlang programs lends itself to distribution accross
                several computers on a network. The Erlang VM can handle distribution transparently behind the scenes.</li>
                <li>Functional Style: The declarative nature of the language reduces the amount of code you need to write</li>
                <li>The OTP Framework: The Open Telephony Platform is Erlang's standard library. Not only does it provide a bevy 
                of modules for various tasks, it also has powerful libraries for common abstractions. You can implement common
                Erlang design patterns like servers, event handlers, finite state machines and event handlers all by simply
                implementing callback routines for these patterns. On top of all that are debugging, tracing, code coverage and
                static analysis tools built right into the standard erlang distribution.
                <li>Hot Code Reloading: The VM and standard libraries are designed to allow code changes to be brought
                online without disrupting any current clients or doing any rolling shutdowns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While you may be unfamiliar with Erlang as a language you've probably encountered a service that uses Erlang to run it's back end.
            Some examples</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Facebook Chat: Built using Ejabberd an erlang XMPP implementation</li>
                <li>Activision Blizzard: Runs Call of Duty servers on Erlang</li>
                <li>What's App: Erlang Backend handles up to 10 billion messages a day. 2.8 Million connections to a single BSD server.</li>
                <li>Distributed Databases: CouchDB, CouchBase and Riak are written in Erlang</li>
                <li>RabbitMQ: An Erlang AMQP implementation</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
            The goal today is to introduce you to the basics of Erlang programming and to have some fun! 
            I unfortunately cannot guarantee that all the code we'll come up with today will be idiomatic Erlang as written by an expert. 
            But hopefully I can suprise you with how useful Erlang is.
